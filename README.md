# 42 C++ Modules

## 📚 About the Project

This repository contains all **C++ modules** developed as part of the 42 programming curriculum. The goal of this series is to introduce and reinforce modern C++ concepts such as object-oriented programming, memory management, inheritance, operator overloading, templates, the standard library, and more.

Each module builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing more advanced topics and coding patterns used in professional C++ development.

> ⚙️ All modules are written in **C++98** standard, as per 42 school requirements.

## 📦 General Requirements

- Compliant with **C++98**
- No use of STL (except where explicitly allowed)
- Follow canonical class form when appropriate
- Proper memory management (no leaks)
- Modular, readable, and well-documented code

## 🔍 Module Breakdown

### 🧱 Module 00 – Basic OOP, Classes & Member Functions

> Focus: Creating and using classes in C++

- Basic class definition and syntax
- Public/private member access
- Member functions and constructors
- Stack vs. heap allocation
- Instance creation, destruction, and scope

### ⚙️ Module 01 – Memory Allocation, References & Pointers

> Focus: Deeper look into memory and references

- Understanding `new` and `delete`
- References vs. pointers
- File operations in C++
- Understanding the behavior of references in function arguments

### 🧠 Module 02 – Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Overloading & Orthodox Canonical Form

> Focus: Operator overloading and proper class form

- Operator overloading (`=`, `<<`, etc.)
- Copy constructor, destructor, assignment operator
- Static members and functions
- Stream output overloading

### 🧬 Module 03 – Inheritance & Polymorphism

> Focus: Classical inheritance

- Public inheritance
- Virtual methods and dynamic binding
- Base and derived class interactions
- Proper use of constructors/destructors in inheritance

### 🧪 Module 04 – Abstract Classes & Interfaces

> Focus: Deeper polymorphism and abstraction

- Pure virtual functions
- Abstract base classes
- Interfaces and dynamic dispatch
- Factory design pattern basics

### 🧰 Module 05 – Exceptions

> Focus: Exception handling

- `try`, `catch`, `throw`
- Custom exception classes
- Exception safety and correctness
- Best practices for throwing and catching exceptions

### 🧪 Module 06 – C++ Casts

> Focus: Static, dynamic, const, and reinterpret casts

- `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`
- Type safety and conversion
- Practical use-cases and potential pitfalls

### 🧠 Module 07 – Templates

> Focus: Template programming

- Function and class templates
- Template specialization and instantiation
- Understanding template compilation model
- Flexibility and code reuse via templates

### 🧲 Module 08 – Templated Containers & STL

> Focus: Using STL and iterators

- Working with `std::vector`, `std::list`, and iterators
- Implementing custom containers (when required)
- Understanding iterator traits and algorithms
- Efficient use of STL containers and patterns

## 💡 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp_modules.git
   cd cpp_modules
   ```

2. Navigate to a specific module:
   ```bash
   cd module_04
   make
   ./example_program
   ```

> Each module contains its own `Makefile`, main program, and test files where applicable.
